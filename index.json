Sira sira ung plastic ng item sa loob, sana maayos nila packaging ng mismong itemrThe returning process is seamless and takes little effort especially with the introduction of popstation at post offices. We can easily drop the item for refund or return at the station. And not to mention free postage provided for all refunds and returns which makes it even easier. oNo Complaints so far Just exchanging a product for the first time today, so we see how that goes before I react.

"NiltFirst return on Jan 12 - too early to commentyAlways have problem with popstation delivery. No sms or email when parcel is being delivered. No pin code give. Had to call Singpost to rectify such problem. Singpost informed customer that Zalora should be the one to send out the pin code for popstation locker. Twice very bad experience for Popstation. epayment process is complicated if delivery is to popstation. uI could not exchange my shoes, so I had to refund them ('order failed'). In the end after the money got credited into my wallet, the sizes I wanted were OOS, even though it was a house brand pair of shoes.  Some filters to consider:- adding casual style clothes - being able to toggle on/off types of clothes (eg tops + skirts + jeans)oCustomer service here, mean through email,is good. dWould appreciate if a refund to credit card is possible instead of the Zalora wallet.vDelivery Man is very responsible.. Will always call & sms for every delivery to make sure i acknowledge.  Only disadvantage is that money will be kept in wallet when items are exchanged before. nto include filtering such as sleeve or sleeveless.nTiming not that clear, but delivery agents are quite flexible when dropping off the itemuNo customer service interaction. Big thumbs up on refund as it's very quick and easy ethere is no effort in resolving any return product. Each return is taking longer and longer.nI don't get refunds back to my card anymore and it goes straight into e-wallet which I feel uncomfortable aboutiBut it does not prompt which address you would like to send to. There doesn't seem to have a choice to collect it from POPstation on the pc website as well. .Good.eNo reply regarding my return!RZALORA printed incomplete delivery address to Singpost. Hence they were not able to deliver. I had to ring ZALORA afterwards to find out what was wrong. The two pairs of shoes were still not deliver within the next few days as that was during the new year period. But no one called to inform me and I sat around my office waiting for my items for 4 days... This is not the first time it happened. Two years back, the same thing happened. I did no received my items and had to call in. The delivery man never deliver to me. I always had to walk a long way to collect from the delivery man, wherever he packed his car since I selected NTU (office address) as delivery point. For my recent order to NTU by Singpost, the problem was because ZALORA only printed NTU as the delivery address. The complete address should include block, unit no. and postcode. I am not sure why Singpost did not ring me when they couldn't identify where to deliver to since my mobile no. was provided. Maybe it wasn't printed on the package.",
"Good Fast delivery and like it  bcos can returned within 30 daysyAlways have problem returning through an pop stationlShould really bring back Nets Internet BankingFeg: Filtering in 'Women's Clothings' for long sleeve blouses, men's clothing will come up too, giving my online shopping experience time consuming.rOrder keeps getting cancelled. No reason providedtPOPstation is less than satisfactory. I didnt receive any pin number and Singpost customer service line isnt easy to reach as its always busy. By the time i called, they informed that i had to collect my Parcel on the same day by 1159pm otherwise it will be sent back to Zalora warehouse!dWould be great if we can filter by available sizes! So that we only see products in our sizes that are in stock..tI got my refund or returned item within few days only..  Keep it up!

"Everything is good, except that when I save my credit card details, it automatically uses that card without confirming whether I want to pay using that card or another card. mToo many products though. Not all clothing are nice. So very tiring to browse vDelivery agent not able to advise approx delivery time. Need to wait whole day long. Preferably, customer is allowed to select time slot like delivery morning/afternoon/evening.  Have not tried refund. Only exchange.eBummer that the price dropped right after I made the purchase. Take quite a while for the refund to happenlUnable to filter. Should remember what I like and show those to me when I open app.  Good online site, good service!wFor working person like me I can only take delivery on weekday nights or on weekends. It is hard to reschedule the delivery because the customer service responds very slowly. It will be very helpful if you can explore delivery to Popstations. It will also save costs when you can avoid multiple delivery attemptsdThe delivery man made an effort to sms me that he is otw to my house so that i will not miss him😀😀iLooking forward to see nore nice products at reasonable price 😀😀ei prefer using pop stationslatest purchase in Dec 2017 refund was not processed till now although email was sent in Dec 2017 that refund has been madedwould be good to be able to choose pop station for deliveries via the app.eThere should have pages to select so that when we take longer time to see the clothings, the app will not suddenly jam and back to first column of clothes. yRosdy followed through the entire process providing me with the reassurance that it's being well taken care off. iIt will be nice to have measurements of bags (not all has it) and maybe a model holding the bag so we can see how it actually looks.vDelivery is preferably at night.
